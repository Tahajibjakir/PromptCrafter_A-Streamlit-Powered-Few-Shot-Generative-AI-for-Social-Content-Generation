# PromptCrafter_A-Streamlit-Powered-Few-Shot-Generative-AI-for-Social-Content-Generation
PromptCrafter is a powerful and user-friendly Generative AI web application that automatically generates LinkedIn-style social media posts using few-shot learning, structured prompt engineering, and LLM-based text generation. Designed with both practical applications and academic relevance in mind, this tool demonstrates how modern LLMs can be customized for creative content generation through a clean UI and intelligent prompt chaining. Built using Streamlit as the frontend and LangChain with Groq’s LLaMA 3.3-70 b-versatile as the backend LLM, the app allows users to select the desired topic, length, and language (English or Banglish) for the post. It then dynamically generates a well-structured LinkedIn post by sampling from a curated dataset of examples.
